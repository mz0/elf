# This is the python version of readelf binary analysis tool

Hi, so basically the goal of this project is to make python based program for binary analysis plus make a tool for binary obfuscation through editing/ removing `Not Needed Headers` , flipping bits etc.

# Files

`elffun.py` currently the main program file
`elfstruct.py` core
`elftypes.py` useful types for binary analysis

# Work in progress.
